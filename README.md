> [!NOTE]\
> `bun` and `npm` command should be able to used interchangeably once `bun` is installed

## Prerequisite

Install `bun` globally:

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the project

To run both the backend and the frontend, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run just the backend:

```bash
npm run dev-backend
```

To run just the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev-app
```

## Preview

You'll need serve to be installed

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Make a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Now you should be able to run in preview:

```bash
npm run preview
```
